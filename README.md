# Instagram Widget Plugin

Quite few times I had to face very hard time to integrate Instagram in my projects. For WordPress website, the journey was easy because of lot of Free and Premium plugins. But I faced big trouble for others projects. And to solve all of my problem, I created this plugin.

This could be name as plugin or a solution. As I am a WordPress lover and in WordPress we use Plugin to extend any features, thats why i am calling it as plugin.
